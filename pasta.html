    <h2>Delicious pasta with meatballs</h2>
    <p>The meatballs are juicy and packed with flavor, with a fork-tender texture that keeps
         everyone coming back for more. To make things easy and save on mess, 
        I brown the meatballs in the oven on a sheet pan instead of pan-frying 
        them on the stovetop. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
        <li> onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ a large bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li> parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve (optional)</li>
        <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten with a fork</li>
        <li> oil, for roasting</li>
        <li>spaghetti, to serve (about 100g per portion)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>STEP 1
            First, make the meatballs. Split the skins of the sausages and 
            squeeze out the meat into a large mixing bowl.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 2
            Add the mince, onion, parsley, parmesan, 
            breadcrumbs, eggs and lots of seasoning. Get your hands in and mix together 
            really well – the more you squeeze and mash the mince, the more tender the meatballs will be.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 3
            Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Roll the mince mixture 
            into about 50 golf-ball-sized meatballs. Set aside any meatballs for freezing, 
            allowing about five per portion, then spread the rest out in a large roasting tin
             – the meatballs will brown better if spaced out a bit.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 4
            Drizzle with a little oil (about 1 tsp per portion), 
            shake to coat, then roast for 20-30 mins until browned.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 5
            Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. 
            Add the garlic cloves and sizzle for 1 min.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 6
            Stir in the chopped tomatoes, red wine, if using, caster sugar, 
            parsley and seasoning. Simmer for 15-20 mins until slightly thickened.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 7
            Stir in a few basil leaves, if using, spoon out any portions for 
            freezing, then add the cooked meatballs to the pan to keep warm while 
            you cook the spaghetti in a pan of boiling, salted water.</li>
            
        <li>STEP 8
            Spoon the sauce and meatballs over spaghetti, 
            or stir them all together and serve with extra parmesan 
            and a few basil leaves, if you like.</li>
     </ol>
